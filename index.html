							Full-stack & Flutter Developer	
						</h2>
						
						<p>
							I am looking forward to a web developer/software developer position because I am confident that my skills and knowledge that I learned will benefit your company. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I had developed my communication and customer service skills by working as a peer tutor in SUNY Plattsburghâ€™s Claude J. Clark Learning Center and assisting students as a teaching assistant for Discrete Mathematics with Computer Applications course. I helped students find the solutions to their problems as well as giving practice exercises. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I enjoy being challenged and engaging in projects that require me to work extensively as well as coorporate with more talented individuals. 
							Hence, I participated honorably received 1<sup>st</sup> place with my teammates in the Plattsburgh Hackathon. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							My coding skills are enhanced by my recent internship at Innovative Technology Development Corporation. Recently this summer, I worked on a car parking manager project as a leader in the internship student team. I obtained more knowledge in project managing skill, communication skill and teamwork skill significantly after my internship duration.
